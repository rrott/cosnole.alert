- reflect console.log() calls in the **toast messages**.  
- trigger window.**alert()** on all console.**log()** calls.  
- use **console**.alert() instead of **window**.alert()  
- define **custom global methods** to call alert()  
- use **regexp** or a **"stop-word"** to call alert()  
- use **allow/block-lists** or enable it for **localhost** only.  
- use it to see console.log() events called in an **iframe**.
